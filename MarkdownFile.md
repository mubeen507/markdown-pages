**Testing:**

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

**Deployment:**

A deployment in general refers to the process of releasing and updating software applications, services, and infrastructure in a controlled and predictable manner. It involves creating, testing, and delivering software updates to various environments such as development, staging, and production. The goal of a deployment is to ensure that new changes are made available to end-users in a reliable and consistent manner
